# Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Project memory bank initialized with all core files
- ✅ Requirements clarified and documented
- ✅ Technology stack decided and implemented (Flutter mobile, React web, WebSocket LAN)
- ✅ Design reference provided (HTML sample with Tailwind CSS grid)

## Current Status
**MVP implemented** - Core functionality implemented; run testing and verification to confirm stability and address platform parity issues

## Completed Features

### Web App (PC Display)
- ✅ React + Vite + Tailwind CSS setup
- ✅ WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
- ✅ QR code pairing component
- ✅ Responsive grid layout
- ✅ Core widgets implemented:
  - Clock widget (with phone time fallback)
  - Media player widget (with progress bar)
  - Battery widget (phone + PC, circular progress)
  - Weather widget (with icon mapping)

### WebSocket Server
- ✅ Node.js WebSocket relay server
- ✅ Token-based pairing system
- ✅ Session management (phone ↔ display)
- ✅ Data forwarding

### Mobile App (Flutter)
- ✅ Flutter project structure
- ✅ QR code scanner for pairing
- ✅ WebSocket client with connection handling
- ✅ Data collection services:
  - Clock service (device time)
  - Battery service (phone battery)
  - Media service (basic playback detection)
  - Weather service (Open-Meteo API with caching)
- ✅ Automatic data transmission (1 second interval)
- ✅ UI screens (pairing, connected states)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. Enhanced media detection (better platform integration)
2. Drag-and-drop grid layout system
3. Multiple themes implementation
4. Settings persistence
5. Electron wrapper for web app
6. Enhanced error handling and reconnection UI

## Known Issues/Risks
- Platform parity for media/battery APIs (Android vs iOS differences)
- Same LAN requirement (no internet fallback)
- WebSocket connection reliability on various routers/firewalls
- Battery drain on phone with 1-second updates (may need optimization)
