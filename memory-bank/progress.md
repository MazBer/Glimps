# Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Project memory bank initialized with all core files
- ✅ Requirements clarified and documented
- ✅ Technology stack decided (Flutter mobile, React web, WebSocket LAN)
- ✅ Design reference provided (HTML sample with Tailwind CSS grid)

## Current Status
**Planning Phase Complete** - Ready to begin development

## Next Up (Development Phase)
1. Create project structure:
   - `/mobile` - Flutter app
   - `/web` - React + Vite app
   - `/docs` - Additional documentation

2. Set up mobile app:
   - Flutter project initialization
   - WebSocket client implementation
   - QR code scanner integration
   - Platform APIs (media, battery, time)

3. Set up web app:
   - React + Vite project
   - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - WebSocket server implementation
   - QR code generator
   - Grid layout component

4. Build core widgets:
   - Clock widget
   - Media player widget
   - Battery widget (phone + PC)
   - Weather widget

5. Implement drag-and-drop grid system

## Known Issues/Risks
- Platform parity for media/battery APIs (Android vs iOS differences)
- Same LAN requirement (no internet fallback)
- WebSocket connection reliability on various routers/firewalls
- Battery drain on phone with 1-second updates (may need optimization)
